So I restarted my old renderer. This code goes back a few years.
Syntax was the name I was calling my DirectX9 renderer back in 2008-9 days. 
Basic engine coding had always been a side hobby of mine ever since I 
was a student learning game coding, and I kept it going while working 
at THQ, occasionally losing interest only to return again.

Originally my first engine was called "Eg" as in an example engine. 
Heavily influenced by the Auran Jet engine, and by books I was reading 
at the time (3D Game Engine Design by David Eberly). It worked, had its 
own 3D Studio MAX exporter, and had a large robust structure. But "robust" 
ended up meaning "bloated". After Eg it became "Nemesis" because it 
always seemed to have some sort of issue I had to return to, and I kept 
trying to take away the bloat but after a month or so I'd always realise 
I've just made it worse. A few versions later it became "Reverie", but 
that iteration of the engine was dropped early as it just wasn't working 
the way I wanted. I started a full redesign, keeping certain parts, and 
ended up calling the new version "Syntax".

Syntax was originally a forward renderer in DX9, but eventually I changed 
it to a deferred engine using DX11 and called it Syntax2.

And now this new incarnation of Syntax returns it back to version 1, 
switching it to OpenGL and never looking back. The engine is miniscule 
compared to what it was, and its aim is to give me a small code-base to 
work from when testing out little shader ideas.

It may take a little to get it back to its glory days, but it'll get there. 
I have been inspired to get back in to it after a student posted some links 
to a few interesting tutorials I'd like to try out (one was very similar to 
my SSAO technique but seemed simpler) and after a friend showed me some 
videos of his current shader shenanigans that also put me to shame.

So let's see how far I get with it this time!

TODO List for Syntax:

	- Refactor Shader system to be more flexible and easier to understand.
		SharedUniforms are great, but I need to simplify it a little more if I can.
		I also need to set up shaders to support Compute shaders.
		I need to allow shaders to be built from strings, not just files, 
		and allow reloading of string-based shaders.
		Perhaps try and come up with a system that "builds" shaders from 
		strings depending on material features.
		
	- Compute
		Need support for GLSL Compute shaders.
		Can also add in OpenCL, but I feel that shouldn't be a part of the core.
		
	- Add in a plugin-based system for mesh loading to allow different formats.
		Desired formats include FBX, OBJ and DAE (Collada).
		This needs to be handled "under the hood" so that the ResourceLibrary doesn't care.
		
	- Fix FBX transform error.
		FIRST: Realised the code committed is my old FBX loading code. I need to
		replace this with the newer / faster code.
		If an artist uses FreezeTransforms then the vertices when loaded 
		contain the transform offsets and the mesh's transform is identity, 
		which is horrible for a parented hierarchy.
		
	- Re-test Animation
		Skeletal animation worked last time, but need to re-test.
		Also need to add proper support for morph animation and vertex blending.
		
	- Fix FrameBuffer
		Currently one of the least flexible classes in the code. Needs to be easy to 
		use to create all types of framebuffers, including depth, depth textures and stencils.

	- Flexible Post-Effects pipeline.
		Need to resurrect my Deferred, HDR, DoF, SSAO and SMAA wrappers 
		and refactor them to get rid of as much pointless overhead as possible.
		Need to incorporate SSS and Motion Blur.
	
	- HDR and Tonemapping seemed broken last time round, so fix it!
		Use sRGB as much as possible.
		Incorporate modern lens effects and chromotic aberations.
